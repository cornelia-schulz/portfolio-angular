<div id="about-me" class="about-me">
  <p>Hi there! I'm Cornelia. I love building things with code.</p>
  <p>I have been working in a variety of tech companies building small automation tools on the side as localisation specialist and finally decided I'd love to code fulltime.</p>
  <p>So, initially I spent a lot of time on FreeCodeCamp and then joined the intensive Inspiral Dev Academy Boot Camp. I'm seeking a full-time role where I can help a company achieve their goals.</p>
